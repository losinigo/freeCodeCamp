// In JavaScript all variables and function names are case sensitive. This means that capitalization matters.

var MYVAR;
var MyVar;
var myvar;

/**
 * MYVAR is not the same as MyVar nor myvar. It is possible to have multiple distinct variables
 * with the same name but different casing. It is strongly recommended that for the sake of clarity,
 * you do not use this language feature.
 */

// Best Practice

/**
 * Write variable names in JavaScript in camelCase. In camelCase, multi-word variable names have the first
 * word in lowercase and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized.
 */

// Examples

var someVariable;
var anotherVariableName;
var thisVariableNameIsSoLong;

/**
 * Exercise
 * 
 * Instructions:
 * 
 * Modifty the existing declarations and assignments so their names use CamelCase.
 * 
 * Do not create any new variables
 * 
 * // Variable Declarations
 * var StUdLyCapVaR;
 * var properCamelCase;
 * var TitleCaseOver;
 * 
 * // Variable Assignments
 * STUDLYCAPVAR = 10;
 * PRoperCAmelCAse = "A String";
 * tITLEcASEoVER = 9000;
 */

// Solution

var studlyCapVar;
var properCamelCase;
var titleCaseOver;

studlyCapVar = 10;
properCamelCase = "A String";
titleCaseOver = 9000;
