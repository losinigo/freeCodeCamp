/**
 * When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of undefined.
 * If you do a mathematical operation on an undefined variable your result will be NaN,
 * which means "Not a Number". If you concatenate a string with an undefined variable, 
 * you will get a string of undefined.
 */

/**
 * Exercise
 * 
 * Instructions:
 * 
 * Initialize three variables 'a', 'b', 'c' with the values of '5', '10', and "I am a " respectively
 * so that they will not be undefined.
 */

// Solution

var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = "I am a";
